                    Mixtify is a cocktail kit delivery service. In this project, I conducted competitive research, mapped out a user flow, created wireframes and conducted user testing to ultimately create the prototype you see before you.
                    The project was originally designed for desktop and I then created a tablet and mobile version as well.

                    <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>
                        The goal of this project was to create an easily navigable web design for a consumer product/service. While thinking of a business idea, I thought about the current social situation and what problems consumers were
                        currently facing. One lament I've heard over and over is missing the feeling of being able to go out to bars and enjoy a few drinks with friends. That's how the idea for Mixtify came about. Mixtify aims to provide
                        new experiences and memories for consumers by allowing them to make an activity out of creating cocktails that can become a social event with friends over video chat.

                    <h3>Ideation</h3>

                    <p>
                        I first began by looking at similar products and services currently in the market. I walked through the websites to get a better understanding of their user flow and noted down what information and features would be
                        necessary to add to my own design. To narrow down the screens that I needed to design, I focused on the user flow of a returning customer specifically with the goal statement of "I'm a returning user looking to
                        purchase a new gin cocktail kit". Using this, I then mapped out a general user flow of such a user. With the user flow mapped out, I then began creating low fidelity wireframes of some of the main screens as seen
                        above. At this stage, I was also asked to create a brand guideline doc which can be viewed below
                    </p>

                <div class="row">
                    <!--Row-->
                    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                    <picture>
                        <source srcset="img/mixtify/Mixtify_Ideation@600px.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)" />

                    </picture>
                    <p>
                        Using the low-fidelity wireframes that I already had and the brand guidelines I was tasked to create, I then created mid-fidelity wireframes on Sketch. Keeping in mind that I would be conducting a user test after
                        these mid-fidelity wireframes, I tried to include as much detail without getting bogged down in too much detail.

                    <h3>User Testing</h3>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to conduct a user test to see if the user flow made sense to a new user. I chose to interview people who I knew would use a service such as Mixtify. I gave them a brief introduction to what Mixtify was and
                        gave them the task of purchasing a Gin based cocktail kit. The interviews were all done via video chat so I could get real-time reactions and suggestions. I received a lot of good feedback that I then implemented
                        into my design. Below you can view the full user test complete with initial designs, feedback from each interviewee, analysis, and edited versions of the screens.

                        After editing my designs, I then moved on to creating a tablet and mobile version of my designs. I changed the design layout to better fit the smaller screens as you can see in the photos above. As this project was
                        part of my CareerFoundry course, there are a lot of screens that I have not designed yet and there is certainly room for improvement.
